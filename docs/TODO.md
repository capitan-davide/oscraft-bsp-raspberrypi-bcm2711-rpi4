# To do

Work planned for the BSP and its startup library, roughly in order.

## Startup: finished

Done (2026-10-28): compressed images (UCL, the only kind QNX's startup
boots), the common options QNX's startup library acts on, pointer
authentication, and the board's diagnostics at `-vvvv`. Not done, by
choice: `-Q` (QNX Hypervisor: the kernel at EL2) and `-I`/`-i` (restoring
an image file system kept across a warm reset), which need a product or a
setup this project does not have; revisit if needed. The rule: provide
what QNX's original startup does, and weigh anything beyond it.

## Board bring-up (when the Raspberry Pi 4 is available)

- [ ] `make sdcard`: a bootable SD card image with the GPU firmware
      (`start4.elf`, `fixup4.dat`, the device tree), `config.txt` and the
      image, fetched pinned and checked like the device tree.
- [ ] The QEMU test, `tools/qemu/test.py`, over a serial port, so that the
      same checks run on the board.
- [ ] A bring-up checklist in the book, and what each failure means.
- [ ] Check on the board what QEMU cannot: reboot and the watchdog, UART3
      (`-D pl011-3`), MSIs from the PCIe USB controller, `-u arg` under
      U-Boot, caches and timing on real hardware.

## Housekeeping

- [ ] A `LICENSE` file (Apache-2.0) in both repositories.
- [ ] Tag `oscraft-startup` v0.1.0 and pin the BSP to it.
- [x] The books checked, built and published on GitHub Pages, in both
      repositories.
- [ ] Continuous integration for the code too, in both repositories: unit
      tests, clippy, formatting (none needs the QNX SDP).

## The rest of the BSP: drivers

Today the image uses QNX's prebuilt drivers from its Raspberry Pi 4 BSP,
and they work with our startup. Writing them in Rust is a separate
decision, to take later.

| Driver | Does | C size | Built on (QNX library) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `devc-serminiuart` | the console, mini-UART | ~1,000 | `io-char` |
| `devc-serpl011` | the PL011 UARTs | ~1,800 | `io-char` |
| `i2c-bcm2711` | I2C | ~1,200 | I2C master framework |
| `spi-bcm2711` | SPI | ~1,700 | SPI master framework |
| `devb-sdmmc-bcm2711` | the SD card | ~24,000 | `io-blk`, CAM |
| `gpio-bcm2711`, `mbox-bcm2711` | GPIO, the GPU mailbox | ~1,000 | resource manager |
| DMA library | DMA for the above | ~2,400 | |
| PCI module, Ethernet, USB | | prebuilt only | PCI server, `io-sock` |

The choice, as for startup and `libstartup.a`:

1. keep QNX's drivers;
2. Rust hardware layers on QNX's C frameworks, through FFI;
3. all Rust, the frameworks too (a resource manager crate, a terminal
   crate, a block device crate): several times the startup's work.

Before any of them:

- [ ] Rust for QNX programs: `aarch64-unknown-nto-qnx800` is a tier-3
      Rust target, with no prebuilt standard library. QNX ships a Rust
      toolchain package for SDP 8.0 (`com.qnx.qnx800.host.linux.x86_64.rust`),
      not installed yet.
- [ ] Rust bindings to QNX's APIs: resource managers, interrupts, mapping
      device memory.
- [ ] A pilot: `mbox-bcm2711` (small, no framework under it), then decide
      between 2 and 3, driver by driver; serial next, the SD card last.
- Most drivers can only be tested on the board: QEMU's models of I2C, SPI
  and the SD card are partial.
